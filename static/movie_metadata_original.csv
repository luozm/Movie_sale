were interviewed for 7 Up in 1964 it was
immediately evident that their social
backgrounds influenced their attitudes
towards life. While the upper class
children were confident and self-
assured, those from middle and working
class backgrounds were resigned to a
challenging life of hard work. This
premise was put to the test every seven
years when the same group were
interviewed about the progression of
their lives. 49 years in the making, the
changes that occurred to the original 14
make for fascinating television and are
in many ways the stories of all our
lives. From success and disappointment,
marriage and childbirth, to poverty and
illness, nearly every facet of life has
been captured on film. Now, at the age
of 56, the group are once more brought
together and, with the benefit of
hindsight, assess whether their lives
have been ruled by circumstance or self-
determination.","Documentary","N/A","N/A","N/A","2012-05-14","N/A","Spain - United Kingdom - USA - Australia","1:08:31","Michael Apted","N/A","N/A","collection","0","The UP Series","56 Up","2018-10-16","2018-10-16","N/A","VTS_01_1 T80 2_0ch 192Kbps DELAY 0ms","eng - eng","N/A - N/A","srt - srt","N/A - N/A","N/A","N/A","http://www.imdb.com/title/tt2147134","en","/library/metadata/6044/thumb/1539686463","/library/metadata/6044/art/1539686463","N/A","N/A"

China, the city of Datong now lies in
near ruins. Not only is it the most
polluted city in the country, it is also
crippled by decrepit infrastructure and
even shakier economic prospects. But
Mayor Geng Tanbo plans to change all
that, announcing a bold, new plan to
return Datong to its former glory, the
cultural haven it was some 1,600 years
ago. Such declarations, however, come at
a devastatingly high cost. Thousands of
homes are to be bulldozed, and a half-
million of its residents (30 percent of
Datong’s total population) will be
relocated under his watch. Whether he
succeeds depends entirely on his ability
to calm swarms of furious workers and an
increasingly perturbed ruling elite. The
Chinese Mayor captures, with remarkable
access, a man and, by extension, a
country leaping frantically into an
increasingly unstable future.","Documentary - Drama - News","1","2018-10-19","N/A","2015-03-06","N/A","China","1:26:05","Zhou Hao","Li Fu - Geng Yangbo","N/A","N/A","0","N/A","大同","2018-10-17","2018-10-18","eng","N/A","eng - eng - eng","N/A - N/A - N/A","srt - srt - srt","N/A - N/A - N/A","N/A","N/A","http://www.imdb.com/title/tt4056808","en","/library/metadata/6132/thumb/1539919977","/library/metadata/6132/art/1539919977","N/A","N/A"
